Aurora to Ethernet Bridge
-------------------------

This EDK project is based on the tutorial by FPGA Developer:

http://www.fpgadeveloper.com/2009/09/aurora-to-ethernet-bridge.html

It creates an Aurora to Ethernet bridge connection and serves
as a base design to begin an Aurora project or an Ethernet
project.

You are free to use this code in your own designs, but please 
acknowledge my work by leaving a link to the website. Thanks.
